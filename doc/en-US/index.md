Excuse me, because of busy work, I just published two componentsï¼š

+ [NumberInput](./numberInput.md) - control input number string.
+ [Fluctuation](./fluctuation.md) - control the styles of up and down.

A few times later, I will publish more components, and it will support vue and react frameworks.
